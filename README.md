# Breast-Cancer-Classification-with-Support-Vector-Machine
This project aims to develop a classification model for breast cancer diagnosis using Support Vector Machines (SVM). The dataset consists of biological features related to breast cancer diagnosis. Initially, the dataset was scaled using StandardScaler to ensure that all features were within a standard range. Next, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce the dimensionality of the data to two components, enabling easier visualization. During model training, the SVM algorithm was employed, and hyperparameter optimization was performed using GridSearchCV. Parameters such as the kernel type, C, and gamma were optimized in this process.

The model's performance was evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC. The results demonstrate that the model achieves a high accuracy rate (98.2%) and excellent classification performance. Additionally, the decision boundary was visualized using PCA-reduced data, effectively showcasing the model's classification capability in a two-dimensional graph. Libraries such as Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn were utilized in this project. This work highlights the powerful performance of SVM in biomedical data analysis and its effectiveness as a tool for breast cancer diagnosis.
